The approach and lectures helped me to understand better and then I subscribed to CA final classes, each chapter alone with practical examples made it very interesting and quizzes after each chapter made me assist my understanding right away. I not only cleared Group II but scored 72 in IDT and good marking in AMA. Thanks to LearnCab for this wonderful platform now I can study anytime anywhere.",
